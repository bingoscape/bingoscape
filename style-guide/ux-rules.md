# UX Rules & Principles

A practical guide to foundational UX principles for building user-centered products.

---

## 1. **User-Centered Design**

> Design for the user, not for yourself.

- Conduct user research and gather feedback early.
- Define clear user personas.
- Prioritize real user needs over internal assumptions.

---

## 2. **Consistency**

> Familiarity builds trust and reduces cognitive load.

- Use consistent navigation, UI components, and patterns.
- Align terminology, color schemes, and layout across all pages.
- Follow established platform guidelines (e.g., Apple HIG, Google Material).

---

## 3. **Hierarchy & Clarity**

> Make important elements stand out and content scannable.

- Use visual hierarchy (size, color, spacing) to guide attention.
- Group related elements together.
- Keep layouts simple and avoid unnecessary decoration.

---

## 4. **Feedback & Responsiveness**

> Always let users know what’s going on.

- Provide immediate feedback on actions (e.g., button presses, loading).
- Show progress indicators where needed.
- Use animations sparingly to enhance, not distract.

---

## 5. **Accessibility**

> Make your product usable for everyone.

- Ensure keyboard navigability and screen reader support.
- Use proper contrast ratios and legible fonts.
- Add alt text for images and clear labels for form elements.

---

## 6. **Affordance & Signifiers**

> Make it obvious what can be done.

- Buttons should look clickable.
- Sliders, toggles, and dropdowns should clearly indicate interactivity.
- Use iconography and labels that signal intent.

---

## 7. **Simplicity & Minimalism**

> Less is more when it comes to usability.

- Eliminate unnecessary features, fields, and words.
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps.
- Use whitespace to reduce visual clutter.

---

## 8. **Error Prevention & Recovery**

> Help users avoid mistakes—and recover gracefully if they do.

- Use constraints (e.g., input validation, disabled buttons).
- Provide clear error messages with solutions.
- Support undo and redo where possible.

---

## 9. **Mobile-First & Responsive Design**

> Start with the smallest screen and scale up.

- Design for touch interactions and small screens first.
- Ensure content and features adapt smoothly across devices.
- Prioritize performance and load speed.

---

## 10. **User Control & Flexibility**

> Let users feel in control, not controlled.

- Avoid unexpected actions or navigation traps.
- Support shortcuts and customizations for power users.
- Allow users to change settings and undo actions.
