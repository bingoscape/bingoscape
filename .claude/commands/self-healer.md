# UI Healing System

## Step 1

Step 1 is to take a screenshot of each screen in question using the Playwright MCP

## Step 2

Step 2, reference the directory /style-guide/ and find the files style-guide.md and ux-rules.md

Based on those files, you are to grade the outputs of Step 1 objectively against that standard, and give your response on a scale of 1 to 10

## Step 3

For any screens or components that have a score less than 8 out of 10, you must make changes, and then repeat from Step 1.
